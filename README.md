 In this assignment, I wired up a LED to a Metro Express and made it blink. I knew how to do this with an Arduino, but not a Metro Express, so I made my best guess on what the code would be, looked up the answer, saw how wrong I was, read the comments on the code to understand why it did what it did, and then uploaded it to the board.
